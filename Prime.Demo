                        forms of leave. Breaches of the Code may result in the Disciplinary Procedure which may result

                    </b>
                    <p>Welcome to the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at Prime University. As the Dean of the
                        Faculty, I am honored to let
                        you know that ours is one of the oldest Faculties of Prime University, established in 2002.
                        Currently, the Faculty has
                        three departments: English, Bangla, and Education. A degree from the Faculty of Arts and Social
                        Sciences empowers
                        students not only to earn a better living but also to shape a life worthy of respect. Our
                        academic programs inculcate in
                        students better cultural and social understanding, and equip them with effective communication
                        skill, strong writing
                        ability and ample power of critical thinking, creativity and emotional intelligence–all
                        essential for a successful
                        career and a well-lived life. What we attach supreme value to is academic excellence. We
                        facilitate teaching-learning
                        and research of the highest quality. Doubtless, we insist on the very best academic standards
                        and practices. Besides,
                        ours is a Faculty which forms the part of a University that is always at pains to make an
                        impression on the outside
                        world, influence the outside world, and matter to the outside world. And hopefully, we are on
                        the highway to achieve the
                        cherished goal and reap the desired harvest. Dedicated to a student-centered planning, the
                        Faculty works with a set of
                        commitments that makes it a unique home for study corresponding to the vision and mission of the
                        University.

                        The Faculty is always at work to explore new areas of learning, and accordingly, updates its
                        curriculum to best suit the
                        changes. Thus, our curriculum has been redesigned in keeping with the Outcome Based Education
                        (OBE) template to meet the
                        needs of the changing society. This Faculty has been manned with outstanding teachers, students,
                        and professionals over
                        the years. We have ambitious programs to entwine the learning and training imparted here with
                        real-world experience
                        including job placements. We seek to sharpen the skills that learners already possess in order
                        to strengthen their
                        ability and widen their experience to help them build a bright future for themselves and make
                        them highly relevant to
                        the world they live in. We in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences do believe in fostering
                        open communications
                        amongst the stakeholders, and therefore, invite queries from students and their guardians, both
                        existing and
                        prospective. I invite all the students to embark on this trying but enlightening and rewarding
                        journey</p>

                        <p>The Department of English enjoys the honour of being one of the five departments with which
                            the Prime University was
                            born in 2002 with the avowed object of turning its students into full men with the
                            development of their qualities of
                            head and heart men able to solve the problems of life with the application of knowledge and
                            skill tinged with
                            humanitarian spirit, judicious awareness and analytical attitude all acquired from the
                            diversified courses that its
                            syllabus contains. The importance of English as an academic discipline has been ever growing
                            with the onward march of
                            the world community. In keeping with this global trend the English program of this
                            University, apart from its
                            traditional literary segments, incorporated within its scope comparative literature,
                            linguistics, language teaching,
                            philosophy, social sciences and humanities , film and media studies, etc. The syllabus is,
                            therefore, tailored to
                            various needs of the students to enable them to be armed with adequate preparations to face
                            the struggle that they will
                            have to win over.
                            The range and diversity of the course are equally matched with the multitude of approaches
                            that are employed including
                            exposition to various literary texts, analysis and evaluation of different genres of English
                            literature, and specialised
                            training in English language teaching. In addition to class teaching, arrangements are in
                            place for seminars and
                            workshops, debates and quiz competitions, dramatic performances and publication of
                            magazines, cultural functions and
                            co-curricular activities to hone the talents that lie latent in our learners ultimately
                            shaping them into useful
                            citizens capable of shouldering the responsibility that the motherland will assign them with
                            after they enter the wide
                            spheres of life demanding competence and performance of them.
                            Not only will they make themselves teachers of English in secondary and tertiary levels of
                            education which is
                            traditionally regarded as the field of work of the English graduates, but they will adorn
                            positions in administration,
